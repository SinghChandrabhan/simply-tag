# simply-tag
A jquery plugin to enable users to add tags.

This plugin allows user to select from a pre defined drop-down list. Any input that is outside this list will be taged as invalid tag.
This is first version of the plugin. I will add new features time to time.

To insert a text as tag use semi-colon(;).

## Demo

I have added a index.html page to see how to use this plugin initially. Later I will add more tests and demo pages

Enjoy simply tag.
